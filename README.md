# Prework Study Guide

## Description

One page web app built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables Coding Bootcamp Students to keep track of their study notes about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript in one place as they learn these web development tools.  

This web app was designed to aid students in their learning.

Although, I knew basic HTML, CSS and Javascript already, with this exercise, I learned some more important Gitflow fundamentals and Gitflow became clearer to me.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section on the page contains notes about a certain topic: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.

If you open the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework.
Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. 

As the JavaScript is running it will pick one topic at random to suggest we learn first.
